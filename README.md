# What is it?

`Explain To Me` is a automatic text summarizer, that utilizes
[TextRank](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf),
a graph based algorithm to scans through the contents of a website to
extract a concise machine generated summary. The methodology is similar
to the way search engines return the most relevant web pages from a
users search query.

# Coming Soon: Under Construction

This should be on the Chrome Web Store Soon
